![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64477577-6012-4d24-b0eb-8093350024b5)

**SafeSend** is an innovative smart contract-powered DApp designed to enhance the security of blockchain transactions. By addressing common human errors like mistyped wallet addresses, SafeSend enables users to securely send crypto assets with the added reassurance of a **claim-back feature**. This feature allows senders to reclaim their funds if the recipient doesn't claim them, minimizing the risk of lost assets and making blockchain interactions more forgiving and user-friendly.  

With an estimated $3.8 billion lost in crypto due to errors last year, SafeSend tackles a pressing issue while contributing to the **Linea Network ecosystem** with educational and practical tools for safer transactions.
